Variable selection based on the following literature:

“It’s encouraging to see progress in decreasing death rates for many types of cancer,” said Betsy A. Kohler, executive director, NAACCR. “Yet the fact that death rates from several cancers are still on the rise means we need to keep working to find strategies to encourage prevention and continue to make improvements in screening and treatment.” [3]
The above paragraph demonstrated the fact that some cancer see decreasing death rates while others increased.

Factors such as Age, Alcohol, Cancer-Causing Substances, Chronic Inflammation, Diet, Hormones, Immunosuppression, Infectious Agents, Obesity, Radiation, Sunlight, Tobacco are the most-studied known or suspected risk factors for cancer. [4]

"Cancer prevention requires smoking cessation, increased ingestion of fruits and vegetables, moderate use of alcohol, caloric restriction, exercise, avoidance of direct exposure to sunlight, minimal meat consumption, use of whole grains, use of vaccinations, and regular check-ups" [5]
